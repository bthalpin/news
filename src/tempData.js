        "content": "NBA Stars usually like to spend big on jewelry – Klay Thompson takes the opposite route by going surprisingly affordable. Klay Thompson wore the same watch not once, but twice during the post-season just gone by. The four-time champ wore a simple and clean gold watch, that could be mistaken for something worth the thousands. The watch in question is a Tissot PRX, which released in 2021. With a price tag starting from 350 dollars, his piece was slightly more expensive, 500 dollars. That is usually how much he fills up in his boat in terms of gas money, so looking at him wear something that a commoner would don is surprising. Considering he makes millions per year, one would not be mistaken if they thought he’d be wearing something around his wrist that shone brighter than the sun. But he chose to keep it low-key, because who wants to be blinded when they want to look at the time. No one looks at their watch anymore, since it is more jewelry than a time-keeper at this point. Switching it up a bit, and using it for its intended purpose, KT kept it functional, yet eye-catching at the same time.

Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet, IWC, and others, seemed to have spearheaded this design movement. If you watched the old James Bond movies, his watch gadget would look pretty similar to this one that Klay wears. Most affordable watches in this price category often design their watches to be gaudy, to cover up for lack of cost. But since Klay is a classy guy, and someone who doesn’t care about the bling (unless you can wear it on your finger after an NBA season), simple seems to be his go-to look. Never appearing on any NBA runway looks, not known for his cars, or flashy houses, Thompson seems to live that comfortable, yet fulfilling lifestyle. He owns multiple statement pieces in his cabinet – none make a statement like the PRX. While anyone would have decked themselves out for the parade, the multi-millionaire chose to keep it low-key. He may have premonished his drunk escapades, which is why he chose to dress down instead of up.

        "content": "Alex Pereira when he fought Sean Strickland at UFC 276. | Photo by Alejandro Salazar/PxImages/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Alex Pereira is 3-0 in the UFC and expected to soon fight for the middleweight title. Alex Pereira wowed audiences in his third ever UFC appearance a few weeks ago. The Brazilian knockout artist showed, by KOing Sean Strickland at UFC 276, that he’s a force to be reckoned with in the UFC middleweight division. Pereira’s success was ideal for the UFC, and MMA headline writers, since ‘Poatan’ has a very well known history with current 185 lb champion Israel Adesanya. Pereira has two wins over Adesanya from their time spent competing in GLORY kickboxing. One of those wins was a devastating knockout. No other fighter, in any sport, has ever KO’d Adesanya. One person who is clearly sold on Pereira’s striking and potential is fellow top middleweight Jack Hermansson. While speaking at the UFC Fight Night: Blaydes vs. Aspinall pre-fight presser the Swede warned his cohorts about the threat the Brazilian poses. “He has the touch of death,” he said (ht Sportskeeda). “And usually, you know, Strickland can be a really hard, tricky person to hit but yeah, if Pereira touches you with that left hook it’s good night for about everybody.” Hermansson fights Chris Curtis this weekend. His last fight was a split decision loss to Strickland in the main event of UFC Vegas 47. Lately ‘The Joker’ has been swinging back and forth between the win and loss columns. Since 2019 he has beaten David Branch, Jacare Souza, Kelvin Gastelum and Edmen Shahbazyan and taken losses to Marvin Vettori and Jared Cannonier. Hermansson is currently ranked 8th in the UFC’s middleweight rankings. Pereira jumped one spot to 5th (tied with Paulo Costa) in the rankings thanks to his win over Strickland. The only men ahead of Pereira are Derek Brunson, Marvin Vettori, Jared Cannonier and Robert Whittaker. All those fighters have lost to Adesanya.",

        "description": "'The Challenge: USA' finale might've involved a serious clash between the production team and the cast. Here's what spoiler accounts said goes down.",
        "content": "MTV’s The Challenge fans love the new CBS spinoff series, The Challenge: USA. So far, viewers see how past players from Survivor, Big Brother, The Amazing Race, and Love Island navigate the social and physical gameplay. A The Challenge: USA spoiler account commented on what’s in store for the finale — and appears production and the cast clashed. Here’s what reportedly went down. [Spoiler alert: The Challenge: USA spoilers ahead regarding the finale.] ‘The Challenge: USA’ spoiler account says there was a clash between production and the cast during the final Shan Smith from ‘The Challenge: USA’ cast | Laura Barisonzi/Paramount T.J. Lavin set the ground rules for the final early on this season. Cast members must accrue $5,000 in their personal bank accounts before they’re eligible to run the final. According to The Challenge: USA spoilers on Reddit, there was a significant clash between production and the cast. “This was extremely disorganized from beginning to end,” spoiler account PinkRose posted, according to Reddit. “Sounds like a lot of the cast wasn’t [a] fan of production and like some may have quit the final.” It’s unclear precisely what the finale entails, but PinkRose then went to call it a “mess” on Vevmo. “The whole final does sound like a big *** mess,” they wrote. “Let’s see how it translates on TV.” Additionally, it seems the finale might involve disqualifications and quitters, though it’s unconfirmed exactly who goes down and when. “This is a disaster and finally exposes the producers for the frauds they are to the big-time executives at Viacom,” another fan wrote on Vevmo after reading the spoilers. “This is primetime network television, you cannot have the show fall apart in the finale. And it sounds like there’s no way they can edit it for it to appear as an ‘insanely tough final.'” PinkRose then stated the weather conditions weren’t ideal, adding to the tension. Who wins ‘The Challenge: USA’? James Wallington and Sarah Lacina | Laura Barisonzi/Paramount Who wins The Challenge: USA? According to The Challenge: USA spoilers from PinkRose, Sarah and Danny win the final. Both players originated from Survivor. To add to the mystery of what’s to come in this final, PinkRose stated on Vevmo that the final has a points system — but Sarah and Danny might’ve been the only ones actually to cross the finish line. Ben, another Survivor alum, seems to have made the final, but it also appears he injures himself and gets disqualified from the competition. Additionally, PinkRose stated the finale was run over the course of two days. The first day involved the cast running the final in pairs, much like how they played the rest of the season. The second day had the cast running as individual competitors. T.J. Lavin said the finale is ‘up there’ in difficulty https://twitter.com/TheChallenge/status/1544878879591976960 The new spinoff series has only just begun, but given The Challenge: USA spoilers, it seems fans have a lot to look forward to for the finale. Host T.J. Lavin also commented on the difficulty level of the final. “If we’re talking about the final challenge, then I’d say it’s up there, man,” Lavin told TVLine. “I’m a tough judge, so it’s probably like a good eight on the scale. It was tough!” He then explained that the finale involved “one final challenge,” and it didn’t extend into a “five-day affair.” “But at the same time, they have that gear they can put it in when they need to step it up that much more before quitting. Like, ‘OK, I’m just gonna go harder.’ That’s something that you need to have on The Challenge,” he added. The Challenge: USA airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on CBS.

The 33-year-old gave a short statement alongside president Joan Laporta, and says he’s hungry to score a lot of goals and bring Barça back to the glory days. “I am very happy to be here. It has been hard to get it done but it was in the end, we have a lot of work to do. “I want to be part of this great club and this impressive story. I want to make a new story and win titles. The last few days haven’t been easy but I’m ready to be part of the team, come to training and hope to play in the coming games. “Forwards have to be prepared to score goals (but) the most important thing is to win, that is my new challenge. You always have to be hungry to win and I’m at the right place for that.” Source: Diario Sport It’s pretty standard stuff from Lewy, but it’s still exciting to hear a new Barça player talking about winning titles again. Especially when it’s the best striker in the world who can be a key piece in getting those trophies. Lewandowski is working individually and hasn’t had any training sessions with his new teammates yet, but he is still hoping to be available for Saturday night’s El Clásico against Real Madrid in Las Vegas.",

    "content": "Photo by Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC A potential No. 1 contender match is the latest to join UFC 280. Top-ranked lightweights Beneil Dariush and Mateusz Gamrot are set to collide in a pivotal bout on the Oct. 22 card. MMA Fighting confirmed the booking Wednesday following an initial report by ESPN. Dariush is currently the No. 5 ranked lightweight in the world on MMA Fighting’s global rankings, while Gamrot is slotted at No. 8. Dariush (21-4-1) has been out of action since his dominant May 2021 victory over former UFC interim champion Tony Ferguson. The 33-year-old veteran was expected to meet Islam Makhachev this past February in a No. 1 contender’s fight at UFC Vegas 49, but was ultimately forced to withdraw due to an injury. Dariush has won seven straight UFC bouts. Gamrot (21-1, 1 NC), likewise, has been red hot since falling short in his 2020 octagon debut. The former KSW two-division champion has won his past four bouts and scored stoppages over Scott Holtzman, Jeremy Stephens, and Diego Ferreira. In his most recent appearance, the 31-year-old Gamrot captured a hard-fought unanimous decision over Arman Tsarukyan to punctuate his first UFC main event. UFC 280 is set to take place at the Etihad Arena in Abu Dhabi. The event is headlined by two title fights: Charles Oliveira vs. Makhachev for the vacant lightweight belt and Aljamain Sterling vs. T.J. Dillashaw for Sterling’s bantamweight championship. MMA Fighting’s Damon Martin contributed to this report.",

  "content": "ANOTHER week, another set of Fortnite challenges fresh for the picking. We’re well into the depths of Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 3 now, and the challenges are getting a little tougher to reflect that. Epic GamesIt’s all action in this week’s Fortnite challenges.[/caption] Gone are the peaceful days of planting seeds and dancing on airship crash sites, now things are getting destructive in Fortnite. Each of these challenges will earn you 15k XP, so it’s worth getting out there and causing the chaos yourself. We’ll run you through each one and explain how to easily complete them. More in Fortnite PUMPED UP Fortnite's new Prime Shotgun is heating things up SHADOW STYLE Fortnite's Shadow Strike pack is back and cooler than ever Crack three opponents’ shields This is a challenge you’re likely to complete in the heat of a match anyway. Finding shield potions and drinking them gives you extra health in battle, but it shatters once the shield hits zero. If you’re getting involved in fights and taking people out, then you’re bound to crack way more than three shields in no time.

It’s a common tactic in a Fortnite firefight to jump like mad in order to make yourself harder to hit. To complete this challenge you only have to land one shot on an airborne opponent, so just take your time when aiming and you’ll hit your target. Destroy 20 structures with a Baller A Baller is a vehicle you can find at the Rave Cave. You had to zip around with them in last week’s Fortnite challenges, but now you’ve got to cause destruction. Simply get inside one, build up a bit of momentum and go charging through any structures you see. Keep the first weapon you collect until you reach the top 20 players Switching weapons to always have the best gear is an important tactic to keep you on top. However, this challenge asks you not to do that, holding onto the first weapon you find. Note, you don’t have to use it the whole game, you just need to keep it in your inventory, so you won’t be stuck with a bad gun all game. Perform an aerial 360 spin while dismounting a Wolf or Boar You can mount a Wolf or Boar by jumping on its back as they charge at you. You can then ride them around to your heart’s content. When you get off, you’ll be flung up into the air a short distance, so just hold your analog stick, or flick your mouse to rotate a full 360 degrees while you’re in the air. Stop the music at Rave Cave As the name implies, Rave Cave is one big party, but this week it’s your duty to be a party pooper by stopping the music. A normal person would do this by turning the power off, but that’s not the Fortnite way. Instead, you’ll need to shoot at the DJ’s table and all of the speakers around it, including those on the scaffolding. Whether you use guns, explosives, or even a tank to do this is up to you. Just don’t expect any thanks from the partygoers.

Some of the shops in Tilted Towers are stuffed with the green cardboard boxes you need to loot.

Jesus and Mina clashed in a recent friendlyArsenal TV There is no love lost between the two South AmericansArsenal TV And following Arsenal’s 3-1 win over Orlando on Wednesday, Brazil star Jesus did not hold back when speaking about the Colombia defender. “You know what, I have played with Mina before in Palmeiras,” Jesus said. “We were so close to each other. Then, after, I don’t know why he started to attack me to do something like this on my chest and then talking s***. I don’t know why. “I don’t know the reason for him to do this. At the end, I am not a kid anymore, and I go straight to him as well. After we won the game, and that’s all.” Jesus has impressed in pre-season since joining Arsenal in a £45million deal from Manchester City. The 25-year-old’s arrival followed a new contract for Eddie Nketiah, ending fears the England youth star could leave on a free transfer this summer.

Nketiah was expected to provide cover for Jesus but after showing a clear chemistry on the pitch in pre-season, Arteta admits he could use them as a front two. The Spaniard said: “We want to build those relationships, and they haven’t played a lot of minutes together yet. The same with Martin and Gabi, for example, and we have to start to do that. “We obviously do it in training, but to put it in practice in matches, it’s important, and you can see that they are finding themselves with good timing, and it’s important because there are two players with a big goal threat.” Offers Of The Day Bet365 – Bet £10 Get £50 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE Open account offer.

  "content": "The future Hall of Famer made quite the gesture on Wednesday. View the original article to see embedded media. Cardinals defensive end J.J. Watt issued quite the gesture Wednesday night as he offered to cover expenses for the funeral of a Texans fan’s grandfather. Watt, who played in Houston from 2011 to ’20, was tagged in a tweet Wednesday as a fan offered to sell a pair of Watt’s Reebok shoes in an attempt to pay for her grandfather’s funeral. But it looks as though she won’t be selling the Watt shoes, after all. This is far from Watt’s first foray into charitable endeavors. He helped raise over $37 million for Houston residents after Hurricane Harvey in 2019, and he currently serves as the president of the Justin J. Watt Foundation, a charity that provides kids with after-school opportunities.Watt is a five-time All-Pro and three-time Defensive Player of the Year. He sports 102 sacks in 135 games, though he logged just one sack in 2021, his first year with Arizona.  Watch the NFL online with fuboTV: Try for free!More NFL Coverage:Fantasy Football PPR Rankings & Stat ProjectionsRunning Back ADP ReportReport: Buccaneers Signing Veteran Tight End Kyle RudolphAll Cardinals: Arizona Cardinals Joint Practices Against Tennessee Titans For more Arizona Cardinals coverage, go to All Cardinals. ",
